### Our Mission
Use the Spotify Web API to gather popularity data centered around some of our favorite artists. We will build a package that can be used to create a data pipeline. Our package will communicate with Spotify, gather the needed data, and place the data into a pandas DataFrame.

We will then perform a light transform on the data to help expose whether or not the "public" considers *our* favorites popular.

packages used:
- pandas
- requests
- python-dotenv
- spotipy
- SQLAlchemy
